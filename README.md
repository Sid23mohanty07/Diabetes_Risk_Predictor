## Model Training

The machine learning model for this project was trained in Google Colab.  
The full training notebook is too large to include in this repository.

ðŸ”— You can access the notebook here: [Diabetes_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L647H5gdTbydx0FqSCe3fluZanGpeT7U?usp=drive_link)

The trained model (`model.pkl`) used in the Flask backend was exported from this notebook.
